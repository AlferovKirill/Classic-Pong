# Classic-Pong
ðŸŽ®ðŸ‘¾ðŸ•¹ This is my first game on Unity2D. It is a classic pong from 70's. 
All the mechanics, sprites, and etc, except music, are made by myself. Because of extortionate developer-contributions from corporations, I post this game here. 
It is distributed under the GNU GPL license. Open source, respectively.
